# Helios Profile for F-5E by MadKreator37
This is a profile for Helios Virtual Cockpit to support the F-5E.
This is a Helios profile for Belsimtek's F-5E Tiger II, designed for DCS World and contributed by @MadKreator37 and @Bluefinbima. 
This profile utilises an aircraft specifc interface which was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project called **Helios**.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)
In addition to the profile, the MFDs can have their viewports exported using patches provided by Helios.

### ABOUT

### Minimum Helios version required: 1.6.612

### Please download and install via the Helios16 installer under ASSETS. Do not clone the repo and copy the files. The profile will not function correctly!

This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the F-5E cockpit, texture files or replicas were designed and created from scratch. Every piece used is specific to the F-5E.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for the F-5e Tiger II in DCS that we could.  There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the F-10 map, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu, f-keys, Kneeboard functions etc... Along with a selectable F-5N Aggressor inspired "MFD". 

### Version 1.0.3 
- Now incluses a night profile along with the standard one. There is anew button to "Transfer Control" directly between the two.
- Tweaked color profile in the Day Version to more resemble the new "F5-E Remaster"
- Cleaned up accessory keys in UI and merged them into a single "Keys" panel
### Version 1.0.4
- Adjust viewport names to match
- minor UI adjustment

*NOTE*: The added functions:  F-keys Esc, Rearm, Briefing, Kneeboard etc buttons require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

*Special thanks to discord user IROPS|Joker for consulting, ideas (like the aggressor style mfd) testing and feedback during creation.*

### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.

-*Remember to always make a back up of files before making changes*
