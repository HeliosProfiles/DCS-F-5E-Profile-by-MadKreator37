# Helios Profile for F-5E by MadKreator37
This is a profile for Helios Virtual Cockpit to support the F-5E.
This is a Helios profile for Belsimtek's F-5E Tiger II, designed for DCS World and contributed by @MadKreator37 and @Bluefinbima. 
This profile utilises an aircraft specifc interface which was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project called **Helios**.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)
In addition to the profile, the MFDs can have their viewports exported using patches provided by Helios.

### ABOUT
This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the F-5E cockpit, texture files or replicas were designed and created from scratch. Every piece used is specific to the F-5E.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for the F-5e Tiger II in DCS that we could.  There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the F-10 map, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu, f-keys, Kneeboard functions etc... Along with a selectable F-5N Aggressor inspired "MFD". 

*NOTE*: The added functions:  F-keys Esc, Rearm, Briefing, Kneeboard etc buttons require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

*Special thanks to @IROPS|Joker for consulting, ideas (like the mfd) testing and feedback from the start.*
